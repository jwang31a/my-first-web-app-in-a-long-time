## PC Stuff Clearance/Discount Tracker

### Description
I was looking at getting a new laptop and other hardware upgrades over the last couple months (summer 2024), but I was wondering if there was a better way to look at all these prices without looking at so many websites. 

### MVP
- Best Buy discounts shown (using BestBuy api)
- At least one other website's prices shown
- Comparison tool if websites sell the same thing?
- Specs comparison tool?
- No accounts needed, so no registering/login, just a database with prices?

### Timeline:
8/21/24
- Came up with idea because I actually need a new laptop
- Basic infrastructure already up b/c I thought about doing another web app before then changed ideas
