## Reddit Clone

### Project Proposal:
This will be my attempt Reddit clone, but with some QoL improvements such as saving posts to a folder and better Markdown or LaTeX support for comments. I hope to have support for images, polls, text, and possibly video posts on both community and personal pages. 
Mainly, I care about getting used to WebDev again by tackling a type of project that I should have some experience in, but with extra moving parts to reflect higher standards and knowledge gained over the years.

### MVP: 
Accounts and pages for each account
Basic communities
Basic support for text, images, and polls
